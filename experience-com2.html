									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" alt="" />
                                    </span> First of all, this is unforgetable community that I'd choosen to join since last year.
                                 I remembered from the start got through every single step of the requirement process was totally not easy for me, 
                                starting the registration to graduation as Netco for Student Batch 2. Here is when I started to think certainly 
                                about what I want to do for now and the next one. All of this started from my curiousity about what kind of role 
                                which are available in telecommunication field. Time passing by, I've accepted as a member of Netco For Student 
                                Batch 2 and have finished some training programs. There are so many task that should be done every 2 week either 
                                as a group or individual.Then we have one on one session after presenting the topic with an expert mentor. 
                                The learning material is also has high comprehansion and explained clearly by the amazing 
                                mentors. Other than radio network topic, some momments we also have live training session with 
                                mentor who has carrier out of telco field or even combining more that 2 field in one role. Beside finishing 
                                 a lot of training, we also conducted some training about current network technology which is still on-going 
                                in Indonesia like 5G Network. The training is generated for student collage and opened for people who has interest
                                on those topic. At the end of the program, there's a series of sharing session from all the mentor about their
                                own career path. My mind is wided open through this session. One thing that I could highlight is there always be 
                                a process behind everyone's story. </p>
