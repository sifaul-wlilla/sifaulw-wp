									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" alt="" />
                                    </span>First and foremost, I had discussed with my intern team the possibility of applying to a telecommunications company or institution.
									After many rejections due to some requirement, a pop-up email notification from LAPAN's satellite center appears.
									We were ecstatic because we knew we'd be learning about satellite communication directly from LAPAN Bogor. 
									Unfortunately, everything abruptly came to a halt. What I meant to refer to here are pandemics.
									It has occurred. True, but college life continues. We spent three months designing a microstrip antenna to be used on Telemetry Tracking and Command(TTC), it's part of satellite communication.
									We had lots of discussions with our LAPAN advisors, especially our advisor who have managed satellite constellations. 
									She implied that we design an antenna with various shapes and use an S-band frequency. So my part is to design a microstrip antenna with a dual-frequency center that operates in the same frequency band as the others. 
									There are frequency centers for uplink 2200 MHz and downlink 2045 MHz, gain upper 3dB, VSWR, circular polarization, losses, and so on for the expected parameters.I was speechless already after three months of friendship with CST Studio.
                                    Began with the installation and progress to the tool's operation. All I can say about my first experience designing and fabricating a microstrip antenna is that everything must be carefully calculated and optimized a dozen times.
									As a result, after the antenna was fabricated. Unfortunately, due to the conditions, it could not be tested. We just finished our journey by presenting our 3-month-long project at a Zoom meeting in front of experts in those fields.
									However, that is nothing more than a sincere thank you for the extensive knowledge of both educational and self-development aspects. Also, special gratitude to my internship team. </p>
