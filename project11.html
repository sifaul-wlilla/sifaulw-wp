                                </span>International Electronics Symposium 2021 “Wireless Technologies and Intelligent Systems for Better Human lives”-
                                "It is a platform for researchers, scientists, and the entire engineering community to meet each other and exchange ideas 
                                on electronic and computer-related fields, and their applications including research stimulation, the applications of electronic 
                                and information technologies, and the discussion to advance for region-wide cooperation in related disciplines". That wasn't 
                                my statement, I quote that from the official website of IES 2021. One thing that came to mind at the time was how I was going to 
                                thank both of my advisors. It might fail, but let's give this a try. Luckily, it was accepted with the same topic as my previous 
                                final project. The hybrid conference has finally arrived. Being extremely trembling while holding a microphone to give a presentation
                                 and the other hand pointing with a pointer was another nervousness. Then there was a question-and-answer session with the other participants. Yeah, it's finally done.
                                One thing I learned from this honors opportunity is that if you keep doing your part, the outcome will adjust. Since I knew from the start that my paper would not stand 
                                out compared with other participants, I knew that other people could easily find tools with the same function. However, it will always be our roles that we need to improve 
                                and innovate, with its most distinct aspect being what is different from the previous system, tools, or even methods. Keep fighting and thank you!. Just in case you're curious 
                                regarding the project details kindly
